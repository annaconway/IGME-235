# Toska: A Game in Space
## I. High Concept
Toska is a survival horde-mode styled game where you fight waves of enemies as the "light" to purge the "darkness."

## II. Genre
The genre of this game is predominantly musou with survival and fighting game qualities. It lacks the complexity and combo accumulation of most fighting games and has a stronger focus on surviving large hordes of enemies as opposed to hunger, thirst, etc. A good example of a musou game would be Nintendo's Hyrule Warriors game where you play as one character defeating armies of enemies mainly by yourself.

## III. Platform
This game is a web browser game so it will be desktop only. It will not be availible on mobile as it would be too clunky to play without creating a seperate app for it.

## IV. Story
You are the largest and longest living star in the universe and you watch sadly as your sisters are dimmed and veiled from your view. The void is taking over and it is your job to bring back light in the suffocating darkness. Fight as the last living light against hordes of darkness.

## V. Aesthetics
The game will be predominantly dark with glowy styled attacks. The artstyle will be 8-bit and rpg-like. Music will be soft 8-bit that envokes the kind of gentle sound of space. Fight music will be more upbeat and sci-fi like. The UI will have sounds when buttons are clicked. Everytime you use an ability a twinkly sound will activate to let you know it was clicked. The main character is inspired by Chang'e from Smite so a lot of the aesthetics will be remniscent of her.

## VI. Gameplay
When players complete a certain number of levels or kill enough enemies, they will receive new skills and buffs that make the subsequent waves easier. This falls in line with the Cascading Information theory and using achievements to keep the player motivated and wondering what comes next. Implementing avoidance in future levels to make the game a little more complicated would be another ideal mechanic. Perhaps during a "milestone" level, this could be implemnted by making the player keep up a certain "light" level. Using skills would add light and force them to prioritize certain mana-burning skills over others.

A keyboard and mouse would be needed to play this game on desktop. In order to beat this game, the player will need to maintain crowd control near the end by using the right abilities in the right situations. It won't be too complicated, but enemy numbers may deploy in large numbers during certain instances so the player must be able to manage this.

There will be multiple skills. A basic magical attack, a stun attack, an AOE attack for larger enemies, and a more random one with light "raining" down to do minor damage to a group.
